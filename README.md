## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

## Overview

The starter project is for a landing page that has a number of sections that can be navigated to dynamically.

These sections are also highlighted when either cliked from the navigation bar or scrolled into the view of the screen.

## Navbar Build

Using both the sectionScroll() and the transferTo() functions the navbar gets highlighted in 2 cases.
First case, is simply clicking on the section from the navbar to be transferred to the desired section.
Second case, is scrolling to a specific section the title is then highlighted.
